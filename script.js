Description:
The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string.
 If you have a string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}.

What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, {}.

Description:
Greed is a dice game played with five six-sided dice. Your mission, should 
you choose to accept it, is to score a throw according to these rules. You 
will always be given an array with five six-sided dice values.

 Three 1's => 1000 points
 Three 6's =>  600 points
 Three 5's =>  500 points
 Three 4's =>  400 points
 Three 3's =>  300 points
 Three 2's =>  200 points
 One   1   =>  100 points
 One   5   =>   50 point

 A single die can only be counted once in each roll. 
 For example, a given "5" can only count as part of 
 a triplet (contributing to the 500 points) or as 
 a single 50 points, but not both in the same roll.

Throw       Score
 ---------   ------------------
 5 1 3 4 1   250:  50 (for the 5) + 2 * 100 (for the 1s)
 1 1 1 3 1   1100: 1000 (for three 1s) + 100 (for the other 1)
 2 4 4 5 4   450:  400 (for three 4s) + 50 (for the 5)

You will be given an array of objects (associative arrays in PHP) 
representing data about developers who have signed up to attend the
next coding meetup that you are organising. The list is ordered
according to who signed up first.

Your task is to return one of the following strings:

< firstName here >, < country here > of the first Python developer who
 has signed up; or
There will be no Python developers if no Python developer has signed up.
For example, given the following input array:





function getFirstPython(list) {
  // Thank you for checking out my kata :)

  const hasPython = list.find((obj) => {
    return obj.language === "Python";
  });

  if (!hasPython) return "There will be no Python developers";

  return `${hasPython.firstName}, ${hasPython.country}`;
}

let list1 = [
  {
    firstName: "Mark",
    lastName: "G.",
    country: "Scotland",
    continent: "Europe",
    age: 22,
    language: "JavaScript",
  },
  {
    firstName: "Victoria",
    lastName: "T.",
    country: "Puerto Rico",
    continent: "Americas",

There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except
for one. Try to find it!
findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

This is the first kata in series:
